# Stylo

Stylo is a semantic writing tool prototype which aims at improving the scientific edition and publication process by putting the production of semantic markup into the hands of the academic writers themselves.


It is designed as a WYSYWYM text editor (What You See Is What You Mean) providing a simple environment dedicated to writing with intra-textual semantic markup possibilities.

Stylo is based on [Texture](https://github.com/substance/texture), a collection of components for realizing content production systems.
